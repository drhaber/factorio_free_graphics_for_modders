# factorio_free_graphics_for_modders
This is meant as a centralized hub for factorio modders, mainly to do kitbashing work or use in their mods.

- I've removed animations when they're available elsewhere, check links in the readme.

- Check licenses before using anything, and credit every modder when you use parts of their work.
